\section {Pileup rejection with R3B MUSIC charge cut}\label{app:r3bmusic_pileup}

As detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:event-sel}, a stringent event selection criterion was applied to the incoming ions. This included a precise charge cut, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:r3bmusic_charge}. The application of a rigid $\pm 1 \sigma$ charge cut, in conjunction with the requirement of a single hit in the Start detector, effectively suppresses pileup events. The superior pileup rejection capability of the R3B MUSIC detector, owing to its longer shaping time compared to the TWIN MUSIC detector, is further demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:r3b_vs_twin_charge_def}. This extended shaping time ensures that any genuine pileup event will be reliably registered by the R3B MUSIC.

\section {MWPCs - \textit{cal-to-hit} data processing}


For all MWPCs the standard  \textit{cal-to-hit} step  sorts the calibrated hits in the detector according to the calibrated charge deposited in the pads. The final position (in mm) is determined by selecting the hit with the highest charge deposition $Q_{max}$ and its left ($Q_L$) and right neighbor ($Q_R$) pads\footnote{In case no charge deposition in one or both neighbors the charge value is set to 1 respectively.}. These charge and position values are inserted in the "hyperbolic squared secant" function \cite{lau1995optimization} with the following charge distribution function:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{a_1}{\cosh^2\left(\frac{\pi (x - a_2)}{a_3}\right)}
\]
\vspace{-0.5em} % Reduces the space between equations
where \(a_1\) is the amplitude of the distribution $Q_{max}$, \(a_2\) its centroid, and \(a_3\) derives as follows:
\[
a_3 = \frac{\pi \omega}{\cosh^{-1}\left(0.5 \times \left(\sqrt{\frac{Q_{\text{max}}}{Q_L}} + \sqrt{\frac{Q_{\text{max}}}{Q_R}}\right)\right)}
\]
\vspace{-0.5em} % Reduces the space between equations
\(\omega\) being the width of the pads. The centroid of the distribution, which is used as final hit position in the \textit{hit-}data level, can be deduced from:
\vspace{-0.5em} % Reduces the space between equations
\[
a_2 = \frac{a_3}{\pi} \times \tanh^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{\frac{Q_{\text{max}}}{Q_L}} - \sqrt{\frac{Q_{\text{max}}}{Q_R}}}{2 \sinh\left(\frac{\pi \omega}{a_3}\right)}\right)
\]
Figure \ref{fig:hyp_function} shows the "hyperbolic squared secant" function with the inserted values for $Q_{max}$, $Q_R$ and $Q_L$. 
\begin{figure}[htpb]

     }
    \label{fig:hyp_function}
\end{figure}
The "hyperbolic squared secant" function is used to determine the x hit position as well as the y hit position for all MWPCs. Figure \ref{fig:x_mw23_default} shows the $x_{mw2}$ versus $x_{mw3}$ distribution of carbon isotopes for the 400 AMeV run with the thick target. The two correlated lines corresponding to the $^{12}$C and $^{11}$C isotopes can clearly be distinguished. The vertical line can be interpreted as amount of events where the incoming centered carbon fragment gets scattered by air or the detector material in place between MWPC2 and MWPC3. The horizontal wide spread line has no physical interpretation and can rather be explained by the \textit{cal-to-hit} step in MWPC2: For events where there is not a spatially constrained hit cluster but sparse hits the hyperbolic squared secant function may pick the wrong $Q_{max}$ and therefore wrongly reconstructs the x position in MWPC2.

     }
    \label{fig:x_mw23_default}
\end{figure}


\subsection {Coherent clustering} 

To overcome the issue with potentially wrong x- or y-position reconstruction in the MWPCs the event selection can be restricted to events where the MWPCs of interest have only one spatially constrained cluster(see figure \ref{fig:own_clustering}) to avoid ambiguities in the position determination.\newline
\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:mw23_own_clustering} shows the distribution of x in MWPC2 and MWPC3 using the coherent clustering reconstruction. This reconstruction method removes the uncorrelated horizontal line which was observed in figure \ref{fig:x_mw23_default}. However the statistics are reduced by approximately $35\%$\footnote{Number of entries in the 2D plot for default reconstruction method: 533816, for the coherent clustering reconstruction: 346315 for the 400 AMeV run with thick target.}.

\section {MWPC0 selection cuts}\label{app:mw0_cuts}

As outlined in Section~\ref{subsec:event-sel}, only events with hits in MWPC0 within a $\pm1\sigma$ around the beam spot center in both the $x$ and $y$ directions were selected, in order to ensure the selection of well-focused incoming particles. The standard \textit{cal-to-hit} procedure was applied to determine the spatial coordinates of the hits.\newline
For completeness, additional strategies were investigated to suppress misreconstructed positions, which manifest as horizontal and vertical bars in Fig.~\ref{fig:mw0_xy_overview}. These strategies included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a coherent-clustering cut, restricted to events where the MWPCs of interest exhibit only one spatially confined cluster, and
    \item cuts on the maximum number of reconstructed hits in $x$ and $y$.
\end{itemize}

\label{fig:mw0_approaches}
\end{figure}
\footnotetext{The ripples in the y-reconstruction reflect the dimension of the readout pads in y-direction}
The effectiveness of these approaches is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:mw0_approaches}. While both methods,when combined, significantly reduce the number of misreconstructed events and improve the spatial hit distribution, they lead to a substantial loss in statistics of more than 40\% (for coherent clustering \& less than 5 hits in x \& y).\newline
Since the $\pm1\sigma$ position cuts were already chosen to be sufficiently tight for the analysis, no additional selection criteria were applied for the MWPC0 event selection.


\section {Alternative methods for TWIN MUSIC hit selection and charge assignment} \label{app:twin_alternative}
To quantify the impact of including or excluding border regions -- i.e., cases where either $\overline{Z_{\text{up}}} = 0$ or $\overline{Z_{\text{down}}} = 0$ as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:twin_2d_gaus_cut} -- on the preliminary estimation of charge-changing cross sections, both scenarios were evaluated and the corresponding results are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:cccs_with_out_border_3_5}. The observed differences are minor. Excluding the border regions leads to a slightly increased spread in the data points for the given beam energies.\newline
\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=8cm,keepaspectratio=true]{Figures/cccs_with_out_border_3_5_sigma.png}
    \caption{
    Preliminary estimation of charge-changing cross sections without geometry corrections. The red data points result from considering also events with only hits in the upstream or downstream anodes, the blue data points don't take these events in consideration.
     }
    \label{fig:cccs_with_out_border_3_5}
\end{figure}

Another method to assert the number survived carbon ions is to apply a diagonal cut on the 2D $\Delta E$ histogram. To set the slope and offset of the diagonal cut line firstly the two dimensional gaussian fit is applied, same as discussed in section~\ref{subsec:carbon_id}. Then the intersection point between the 3.5 $\sigma$ ellipse and the identity line ($\Delta E$ upstream anodes = $\Delta E$ downstream anodes) is found. Through this point, perpendicular to the identity line, the diagonal line is drawn. Everything above the diagonal line is considered as survived carbon ions. The borders are considered within the 3.5 $\sigma$ cut, see figure \ref{fig:diagonal_cut_twim}. 
\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=8cm,keepaspectratio=true]{Figures/charge_loss_550_thick.png}
    \caption{
    Diagonal cut on identified carbon isotopes along the gaussian 3.5 $\sigma$ cut with borders. All hits above the diagonal line are counted as carbon isotopes. Histogram from thick target run, 550 AMeV beam energy.
     }
    \label{fig:diagonal_cut_twim}
\end{figure}
The effects of the two different methods used for the identification of the carbon isotopes for the charge changing cross section is summarized in figure \ref{fig:cccs_gaus_vs_diag}. The differences in the measured cross sections are within the margin of error herefore both methods are comparable, as expected.\newline
\newline

     }
    \label{fig:cccs_gaus_vs_diag}
\end{figure}
To check wether single anodes or groups of anodes are malfunctioning the charge changing cross section measurement was repeated using only certain anodes for the charge identification:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\itemsep0em
\item anodes 2-8 versus anodes 9-15 (omitting first and last anode)
\item anodes 1-4 versus anodes 5-8 (upstream anodes)
\item anodes 5-8 versus anodes 9-12 (central anodes)
\item anodes 9-12 versus anodes 13-16 (downstream anodes)
\end{enumerate}
The results from the measurement are summarized in figure \ref{fig:cccs_gaus_diff_sections}. The difference between the default gaussian fit method (with 3.5$\sigma$ cut and considering the borders) considering all 16 anodes and applying the same method but omitting the first and last anode is minimal over all four beam energies. When selecting only 8 out of 16 anodes instead the cross sections are systematically lower when going to high beam energies. The energy loss inside the TWIN MUSIC slightly decreases with higher beam energies (400 $\rightarrow$ 800 AMeV), according to the Bethe-Bloch formula~\cite{bethe1930theorie}. The decrease of deposited energy for larger beam energies has as consequence a lower relative resolution in the two dimensional $\Delta E$ loss histogram reflecting the poissonian distribution properties. In addition reducing the number of readout anodes by a factor two degrades the resolution by a factor $\sqrt{2}$\footnote{It can be assumed a similar $\Delta$ E distribution for all anodes. Hence the central limit theorem can be applied where $\sigma = \frac{\sigma_{anode}}{\sqrt(n)}$ with $n =$ number of anodes.}. This has as consequence that the ellipsis with 3.5$\sigma$ cut incorporates a non negligible amount of boron isotopes which are counted as survived carbon isotopes which in turn reduces the measured charge changing cross section.

    \label{fig:cccs_gaus_diff_sections}
\end{figure}
While in the above measurements a time based secelction algorithm for multi-hit anodes was used also an energy based selection was tested. This algorithm selects for multi-hit anodes the hit with the highest energy as physical hit and discarts all others, as they are considered as background/noise. Figure \ref{fig:cccs_gaus_time_vs_energy} compares the time based method versus the energy based method. In both cases a two dimensional gaussian 3.5$\sigma$ cut is applied as in figure \ref{fig:twin_2d_gaus_cut} and the borders are counted as well. The difference in the outcome is negligible. This can be explained since noise or background signal should be both uncorrelated to the event time and at a low energy level and are therefore filtered by both algorithms.

\section {TWIN MUSIC Geometric Acceptance Correction via Efficiency Measurement}
Instead of correcting the limited geometric acceptance of TWIN MUSIC via graphical fitting (see section \ref{sec:geo_corr}) it is also feasible correcting via TWIN MUSIC efficiency measurement. The correction factor is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:twin_eff}
\epsilon_{geo\text{\_}corr} = \frac{N_{MWPC1,MWPC2}}{N_{MWPC1,MWPC2,TWIN}}
\end{equation}
where $N_{MWPC1,MWPC2}$ corresponds to the number of events with a hit in MWPC1 and MWPC2 whereas $N_{MWPC1,MWPC2,TWIN}$ imposes the further condition having a hit in TWIN MUSIC too.\newline
The corresponding correction factor $\epsilon_{geo\text{\_}corr}$ is consequently applied on all target and empty runs. The resulting corrected charge changing cross section is shown in figure \ref{fig:twim_corr_cc_cs}.

\section{Flight-Path Reconstruction}\label{app:flightpath}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/drawings_flightpath.png}
    \caption{
        Flightpath reconstruction with reference positions $(z_0,x_0)$, $(z_1,x_1)$ and $(z_2,x_2)$. The GLAD magnet is tilted by $\alpha = 14^{\circ}$.}
    \label{fig:draw_flight}
\end{figure}
The first step in the radius and flightpath reconstruction is expressing the entrance point on the GLAD field $(z_1,x_1)$ and the exit point $(z_2,x_2)$ with the center of the circle path $(z_0,x_0)$ as reference, see figure \ref{fig:draw_flight}:
\begin{align*}
z_1 &= z_0 -r\,cos(90^{\circ}-\theta_i) = z_0 -r\,sin(\theta_i)\\
x_1 &= x_0 + r\,sin(90^{\circ}-\theta_i) = x_0 + r\,cos(\theta_i)\\
\hspace{1cm}
z_2 &= z_0 + r\,cos(90^{\circ}-\theta_o) = z_0 + r\,sin(\theta_o)\\
x_2 &= x_0 + r\,sin(90^{\circ}-\theta_o) = x_0 + r\,cos(\theta_o) 
\end{align*}
The slope $m_1$ of the intersection line between $(z_1,x_1)$ and $(z_2,x_2)$ is given by:
\begin{align*}
m_1 &= \frac{x_2-x_1}{z_2 -z_1} = \frac{cos(\theta_o) - cos(\theta_i)}{sin(\theta_o)+sin(\theta_i)}
\end{align*}
and with the distance between the two points given by:
\begin{align*}
\Delta^2_{i/o} &= r^2 \, \left[(cos\theta_o - cos\theta_i)^2 + (sin\theta_o + sin\theta_i)^2 \right]\\
	       &= 4r^2\,sin^2(\frac{\theta_i}{2} +\frac{\theta_o}{2} )\\
\Rightarrow \Delta_{i/o} &= 2r\,sin(\frac{\theta_i}{2} +\frac{\theta_o}{2})
\end{align*}
To describe the distance between $(z_1,x_1)$ and $(z_2,x_2)$ with the given effective GLAD length $L_{eff}$ ($= 2.06\,m$) the tilting angle $\alpha$ (see figure \ref{fig:draw_flight}) of GLAD in relation to the incoming beam line direction has to be considered. Consequential the angle $\delta$ between the trajectory connecting $(z_1,x_1)$ and $(z_2,x_2)$ and the line parallel to the GLAD magnet width $L_{eff}$ can be determined as:
\begin{flalign*}
tan(\delta) &= \left| \frac{m_1-m_2}{1+ m_1\cdot m_2} \right|
\end{flalign*}
with $m_2 = -tan(\alpha)$:
\begin{align*}
\delta = atan \left( \frac{\frac{cos\theta_o - cos\theta_i}{sin\theta_o + sin\theta_i} + tan\alpha}{1-\frac{cos\theta_o - cos\theta_i}{sin\theta_o + sin\theta_i}\,\cdot\, tan\alpha} \right)
\end{align*}
The final relation between $L_{eff}$ and the bending radius $r$ of the fragment within GLAD can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
L_{eff} &= 2r\,sin(\frac{\theta_i}{2} + \frac{\theta_o}{2})\,\cdot\, cos\delta \\
	&= 2r\,sin(\frac{\theta_i}{2} + \frac{\theta_o}{2})\,\cdot\,\frac{1}{\sqrt{\delta^2+1}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
