\section{Machine Learning for the Cluster Reconstruction in the CALIFA Calorimeter at R$^3$B}
shortly recapitulate how the clustering is done
Motivate with single/double escape peak stuff
Mention that we have time information in CALIFA but we do not use it
WORK IN PROGRESS WITH PAPER WRITING
\subsection{Data Simulation and Selection}

\subsection{Agglomerative Clustering Model}

\subsection{"Edge Model" - Graphical NN}

\subsubsection{Combination of both methods}


\subsection{Results}
