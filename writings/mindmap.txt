-----------STRUCTURE OF LIGHT PARTICLES---------------------

1)Intro & Motivation
-Structure of particles
-Shell model
-Connection to Astrophysics, Neutron Stars, EOS
-Cross section measurements to constrain Symmetry Energy Parameters
-Outline of Thesis

2)Reaction mechanism
-Glauber Model
-QFS Reaction mechanism
-Problems involved in QFS mechanism (read more about it in Valerii's thesis..)
-12C nucleus as test case
-Further outlook on Fission via QFS


3)Experimental Concept/Setup
-Idea of inverse kinematics, kinematically complete measurements
-R3B at GSI/FAIR
-Detector Setup in S444 Experiment in 2020
 *Sofia Setup -> for fission experiments
	**Start & TOFW
	**Tracking via MWPCs
	**Ionisation Chamber TWIM (R3BMusic)
 *CALIFA Detector

4) Analysis Part
-Cuts on incoming ions
-Tracking/Time measurement -> here I have already quite some documentation
-Charge Identification
-CALIFA Clustering
-Final Particle Identification
-Cross Section Measuements

5) Results & Discussion
