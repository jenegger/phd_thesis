\subsection{Quasi-Free Scattering (QFS) Reactions}\label{sec:qfs_theo}
Quasi-free scattering (QFS) reactions, as a subset of direct reactions, are processes where a projectile nucleon interacts with a target nucleon in a single, fast, and highly localized event. The timescale of these interactions is extremely short, approximately $10^{-21}$ s, implying that the relative kinetic energies of the participants are high, typically $\gtrsim$ 100 AMeV.\newline
In QFS experiments conducted in direct kinematics, a proton serves as the projectile, colliding with a nucleon or a cluster within the target nucleus. Conversely, in inverse kinematics, the nucleus of interest becomes the projectile, while a proton or proton-like particle is used as the target. Despite these differing setups, both approaches are fundamentally equivalent, differing only due to a Lorentz transformation of the reference frame.\newline
As the name implies, QFS reactions are conceptually similar to free nucleon-nucleon scattering, with the primary approximation being that the influence of the residual nucleus is neglected to first order. This approximation simplifies the theoretical description of the process, allowing to treat the interaction as a two-body problem within a (only weakly interfering) nuclear environment.\newline
The first experiments confirming the existence of quasi-free scattering processes were conducted at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1952 by O. Chamberlain and Emilio Segr\`e\cite{chamberlain1952proton}. In their study, lithium nuclei were bombarded with 350 MeV protons, and coincident proton pairs were observed with an opening angle of approximately 90$^{\circ}$. That same year, J.B. Cladis, W.N. Hess, and B.J. Moyer published results on the scattering of 340 MeV protons on deuterium and carbon targets\cite{cladis1952nucleon}, further substantiating the phenomenon.\newline
In 1957, Tyren, Maris, and Hillman designed an experiment aimed at fully characterizing proton-proton collisions within the quasi-free scattering framework\cite{MARIS19581}. Their results validated the assumption of a direct and clean interaction between the projectile and the target nucleon, free from significant distortions caused by the surrounding nucleus. Furthermore, these experiments demonstrated that QFS reactions could serve as a powerful tool for probing nuclear structure and testing predictions of the shell model. Specifically, they enabled the study of key nuclear parameters such as spin-orbit splitting and energy differences between nuclear shells and here fore to probe the shell evolution. \newline
In QFS reactions, these parameters can be extracted by analyzing the reaction products, which include the two correlated outgoing protons, the residual nucleus, and any gamma rays emitted during de-excitation of the residual nucleus. The detailed measurements of these observables provide critical insights into the underlying nuclear structure and dynamics.\newline
The experimental discoveries and theoretical insights from these early studies catalyzed significant advancements in the theoretical modeling of QFS reactions. These models have since become essential tools for understanding nucleon-nucleon interactions within the nuclear medium and for refining our knowledge of nuclear structure and reaction mechanisms.\newline
\subsubsection{Kinematics of QFS Reactions}\label{sec:kin_qfs}
A simplified picture, which however explains the essential physics of the QFS reaction, can be found in figure \ref{fig:sketch_qfs}: we have an incoming proton knocking out a nuclear constituent (proton/neutron) in a free nucleon-nucleon collision ending with a final state having the scattered proton, the scattered  off nuclear constituent and the rest nucleus (A-1)$^*$. In this picture index \textit{0} is assigned to the incoming proton, \textit{1} to the knocked out nucleon, \textit{2} to the outgoing projectile proton, \textit{A} to the initial nucleus and  \textit{A-1} to the final nucleus accordingly.
\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=8cm,keepaspectratio=true]{Figures/sketch_qfs.jpg}
    \caption{
   	Simplified picture of the QFS reaction process in direkt kinematics.  
    }
    \label{fig:sketch_qfs}
\end{figure}
From energy -momentum conservation the reaction can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:four_mom_cons_qfs}
P_A  +  P_0 = P_1 + P_2 +P_{A-1} 
\end{equation}
with $P_i$ the four momentum $(\mathbf{p_i},E_i)$.\newline
In direct kinematics as presented in figure \ref{fig:sketch_qfs} the separation of the ejected nucleon for a certain final state of the nucleus \textit{A-1} is given by\footnote{In inverse kinematics the four-momentum vectors need to be boosted to the center of mass frame of the initial nucleus via Lorentz transformation.}:
\begin{equation}
S = T_0 -(T_1+T_2 +T_{A-1}); \; \text{with $T_i$ the kinetic energy of particle $i$} 
\label{eq:sep_e}
\end{equation}
In the idealized shell model the separation energy equals to the (negative) energy of the nucleus' single-particle state. For the case the proton knocks out the least bound nucleon (proton/neutron) the final nucleus is lying in the ground state with $E_{A-1} = M_{A-1}c^2  + T_{A-1}$.\newline
If a nucleon has been ejected from an inner shell resulting in a hole state, the final nucleus will be in an excited state:
\begin{equation}
E^{*}_{A-1} =  M_{A-1}c^2  +T_{A-1} + E_{exe}
\end{equation} 
The excitation energy $E_{exe}$ is reflected in the difference in the separation energy of the least bound nucleon and the ejected one. From the experimental point of view $E_{exe}$ is directly accessible via gamma detection from the transition of the final nucleus from the excited to the ground state. 
According to the picture of having a nucleon nucleon scattering process with no influence of the residual nucleus A-1 we can approximate $\mathbf{p_A} \approx \mathbf{p_i} + \mathbf{p_{A-1}}$ where $\mathbf{p_i}$ is the initial nucleon momentum inside the initial nucleus A. Since the initial nucleus is at rest ($\mathbf{p_A} = 0$), the recoil momentum of the nucleus in final state $\mathbf{p_{A-1}}$ equals to $-\mathbf{p_i}$ the momentum of the initial nucleon pointing in opposite direction. \newline
In addition the four-momentum of the inner nucleon can be deduced from momentum measurement of the initial and final state free nucleons:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:miss_mom}
P_i \approx P_{miss} \equiv P_1 + P_2  - P_0
\end{equation}
where $P_{miss}$ is the so called "measured missing four-momentum of the reaction"\cite{patsyuk2021unperturbed}\footnote{$P_{miss}$ is only equal to $P_i$ for the unperturbed QFS (no ISI/FSI) case.}.
Thereupon, the separation energy measurement and the recoil momentum distribution fully describe the single paricle state in the various shell levels. 
In addition and as complementary method $\gamma$ rays can be measured in coincidence with the reaction and consequentely exclusive cross section and momentum distribution measurements of the single particle states are accessible as illustrated in figure blabla.\newline
Considering the removal of a single nucleon from an initial nucleus with A nucleons and initial spin \textit{I} $\Psi^A_i$ and final nucleus state  $\Psi^{A-1}_f$ with final spin $I_f$ an overlap function between intial and final state many-body wave function can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\langle \vec{r}, \Psi_f^{A^{-1}} | \Psi_i^A \rangle = \sum_j C_j^{if} \psi_j(\vec{r}), \quad with  |I - I_f| < j < |I + I_f|
\end{equation}
where $S_j^{if} = |C_j^{if}|^2$ is the commonly named spectroscopic factor, see ref \cite{hansen2003direct} sec.2.1. $S_j^{if}$ is summed over all final single particle states m (from $-j$ to $j$). It is unity for nucleon removal from a pure single particle state and equals (2j+1) when the nucleon was removed from a filled j-subshell.
The spectroscopic factor is linked to the exclusive experimental cross section measurement of a single particle state and the theoretical predicted one, as in ref \cite{hansen2003direct}:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{th}^{if} = \sum_j S_j^{if}\,\sigma_{sp}(nlj)
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{sp}$ are the theoretical cross sections for the normalized wave functions $\Psi_j$ of the final state nucleus A-1 with the appropriate quantum numbers.\newline
From this considerations the spectroscopic factor can be used to probe the theoretical shell predictions. In past this was already done with direct qfs-reactions $(e,e'p)$. Results for the spectroscopic factor with data obtained at the NIKHEF facility is shown in figure \ref{fig:spec_fac}. The substantial reduction of the spectroscopic factor with respect to the independent particle model (IPM) or mean field of $\approx 35\%$ indicates a substantial depletion of the single-hole states and inferring from this a refined model prediction has to be applied\footnote{The mean field potential does not consider spin-spin interaction $V_{ss}$, non central tensor-potential $V_T$ or spin-orbit interaction $V_{LS}$.}.\newline
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=8cm,keepaspectratio=true]{Figures/spec_factor.png}
    \caption{Normalized spectroscopic factors from the $(e,e'p)$ reaction as a function of target mass taken from \cite{DICKHOFF2004377}. As input for the theoretical cross sections the prediction from mean field models were used. }
    \label{fig:spec_fac}
\end{figure}
While qfs-reaction with electrons $(e,e'p)$ in direct kinematics is a valuable method to make precise measurements for stable (target) nuclei it is not suitable for the experimental analysis with exotic (neutron or proton rich) nuclei. Due to their unstability they have a short lifetime (e.g. $^{52}Ca$ with $\tau = 4.6s$) they can hardly serve as targets. Inducing the reaction in inverse kinematics - having electrons as targets and the exotic nuclei of interest as projectiles - is also not feasible since no free electons can be captured as target. The alternative approach is to use proton induced quasi-free scattering in inverse kinematics where the exotic beam inpinges on an extended proton target such as liquid hydrogen $H_2$  or a fixed proton rich target such as $CH_2$\footnote{Herefore a carbon target reference run is used to extract the qfs-reaction events from the $CH_2$ target run.}.\newline
Summarizing, the qfs-reaction technique in inverse kinematics with exotic nuclei as in-flight projectiles and a proton-like target opens new possibilities to probe theoretical model predictions of deformed nuclei far off stability which haven't been accessible before.\newline
For precise cross section measurements of the single particle states $\sigma_{sp}$ the kinematical characteristics of the qfs-reaction products have to be considered for correct identification of qfs-events and clear background substraction. The following descriptions are already encoded in equation \ref{eq:four_mom_cons_qfs}.\newline
As starting point one compares the qfs-reaction of the two nucleons with the two dimensional non-central collision of free pointlike particles in nonrelativistic kinematics. Since both kinetic energy and momenta are conserved a  clear signature is expected: the opening angle of the scattered particles is exactly 90$^{\circ}$. 

However, at kinetic energies of 400 AMeV and more, relativistic effects affects the opening angle of the scattered particles\footnote{Relativistic considerations become relevant at velocities $ \beta \gtrapprox 0.1 c$. This corresponds to $\approx$ 4.5 MeV.}. 
put in here the formula for the opening angle in realtivisti kinematics, to be derived

For the final description of the process it has to be considered that the projectile nucleon inside the nucleus has a non negligible momentum (see $P_i$ in equation \ref{eq:miss_mom})  and in addition the separation energy $S_{p/n}$ has to be expended to remove the scattered nucleon of the nuclear potential of the projectile nucleus.\newline
To account for the nucleon momentum the picture of the fermi gas model where protons and neutrons freely move inside the nucleus' potential is applied. In the ground state of the nucleus the nucleons can reach a momentum up to the Fermi momentum $p_F$. Except for the light nuclei, the Fermi momentum is almost independent of A and amounts to $\approx 250$ MeV/c \footnote{For light nuclei like $ ^{12}C$, $p_F \approx 230$ MeV/c can be assumed}. The mean quadratic momenta of the nucleons is related to the Fermi momentum by:
\begin{equation}
\langle \mathbf{p}^2 \rangle = \frac{3}{5}p^2_F \footnote{From the derivation of the mean kinetic energy of the nucleons $\langle E_{\text{kin}} \rangle = \frac{\int_0^{p_F} E_{\text{kin}} \, p^2 \, dp}{\int_0^{p_F} p^2 \, dp} = \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{p_F^2}{2M}$}
\end{equation}
The width of the momentum distribution of the nucleons is given in the Goldhaber model by:
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2 = \sigma_0^2 K(A-K)/(A-1), \, \text{with} \, \sigma_0 \approx 90 MeV/c
\end{equation}
where A is the mass number of the projectile nucleus and K the mass number of the fragment after scattering. For a detailed derivation and further readings see ref. \cite{goldhaber1974statistical} and \cite{FESHBACH1973300}.
In the impuse approximation, where we assume that the interaction between the projectile and target nucleons has approximately the same form as the interaction between two nucleons in free space, the inner momenta of the scattered nucleons smear out the angular correlations of the outgoing fragment - which has the same momentum as the knocked out nucleon in the cms system of the nucleus but points in opposite direction - as well as of the two nucleons involved in the scattering. As consequence the opening angle distribution of the two scattered nucleons gets broadened as well as the azimuthal angular correlation which for the assumption of zero nucleon momentum sharply peaked at $\Delta\phi = 180^{\circ}$.\newline
In view of the added nucleon momentum the kinematics get expanded from a two dimensional scattering reaction to a three dimensional process where the reaction plane is determined by the plane spanned by the momentum vector of the projectile nucleus $\mathbf{p}_A$ and the scattered nucleon after the reaction \footnote{For (p,2p) reactions there is an ambigousity which of the scattered protons $\mathbf{p}_1$ or $\mathbf{p}_2$ origin from the projectile nucleus or the proton like target.}. With the momentum measurement of the two correlated outgoing nucleons and the momentum of the incoming projectile nucleus it is possible to retrieve the internal momentum of the knocked out nucleon perpendicular to the reaction plane via the formula derived in reference\cite{chulkov2005quasi}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:chulkov}
Q_{\perp i} = sin(\theta_{1/2})\cdot sin(\phi_{1/2} -\phi_{2/1})\cdot\mathbf{p}_{2/1}
\end{equation}
In case of (p,2p) reactions it is impossible to track back the origin of each nucleon - from the projectile nucleus or the proton-like target. Iferrring from this there are two possible solutions for $Q_{\perp}$. The ambiguity can be resolved by incorporating the momentum of the fragment nucleus perpendicular to the reaction plane $Q_{\perp A-1}$. The fragment momentum vector should be of the same amout but point in opposite direction to $Q_{\perp i}$.
TODO: insert here the correlation plot of VALERII, check if that is correct.


Up to this point the scattering process was described similar to the free elastic scattering in relativistic kinematics with the projectile nucleon having a non negligible momentum. However the projectile nucleon is an off-shell particle  bound inside the nucleus. 
\begin{equation}
\mu_i =  \sqrt{m_A^2 + m_{A-1}^2 + 2m_A\sqrt{m_{A-1}^2 + |\mathbf{p}_i|^2}}
\end{equation}
in the c.m.s. of the projectile nucleus, with
\begin{equation}
0 < \mu_i  < m_n
\end{equation}
where $m_n$ is the mass of the appropriate free nucleon.
To knock the bound nucleon out of the nucleus the separation energy has to be overcome which can be observed in the reduced opening angle of the two outgoing correlated nucleons.


\begin{itemize}
\item put in the L.V. Chulkov formula and plot to get the transversal mom etc
\item Last correction: whe have to consider the separation energy(and NOT binding energy) -> makes angle again smaller etc show also on the formula that it gets smaller...this is then also an explanation why it gets smaller if nucleon is knocked out from a deeper shell.
\end{itemize}



%From experimental point of view-> important to identify the QFS events.
%In non rel. kinematics of free particles a really clean signature: two dim-colllision with coplanar nucleons = delta phi = 180 degr and an opening angle of 90 degr. \newline
%When going to rel. energies -> 80 degrees of opening angle(400 AMeV). Is there a function to calculate the opening angle? The opening angle is smeared because of relativistic effects + inner momentum of the nucleon. \newline
%Explain Goldhaber model to characterize the width of the inner momenta.\newline
%Plot the correlation plots of opening angle and delta phi.
%Then mentnion pronounced transversal correlation as in L.V. Chulkov -> insert image
%Moreover limited energy ranges are allowed where the forward nucleon has much higher energy compared to the larger scattered one -> insert image

\subsubsection{Application Fields of QFS Reactions}
Over several decades of experimental and theoretical research, quasi-free scattering (QFS) reactions have been firmly established as a powerful and direct tool for probing the microscopic structure of atomic nuclei. These reactions provide critical insights into nuclear correlations, single-particle properties, and the momentum distributions of nucleons within the nucleus.\newline
The versatility of QFS extends across various applications, including the study of short-range nucleon-nucleon interactions, exotic nuclear states, and the modification of nucleon properties in nuclear matter. Advances in experimental facilities and state-of-the-art detector systems, have significantly improved the precision and scope of QFS measurements. These developments have enabled in-depth investigations of nuclear dynamics, the structure of unstable isotopes, and fundamental aspects of quantum many-body systems, contributing to a deeper understanding of nuclear and subnuclear phenomena.\newline
This subsection will point out the most exciting and promising application fields of QFS reactions with focus on the applicability in the R3B experimental setup. A detailed review can be found in ref \cite{panin2021quasi}.
\begin{description}
\item[Single-Particle Spectroscopic Strength]As already mentioned in section \ref{sec:kin_qfs} in many experiments a reduction in the spectroscopic strength of about 35\% with respect to the independent particle model (IPM) and shell model predictions was observed. In one-nucleon removal reactions - experiments with isotope beams impinging on a composite nuclear target - the extraction of the missing spectroscopic strength is challenging as the kinematical pattern is highly complex. In contrast, the qfs reactions mechanism in inverse kinematics retains a clear kinematical signature which makes it a valuable tool to study the quenching of the spectroscopic factor which originates from residual correlations between bound nucleons inside the nucleus. \newline
Several experiments were carried out at the GSI Facility to study the reduction factor of the spectroscopic strength  and its evolution over a broad range in isotopic chains, such as for oxygen shown in figure \ref{fig:red_factor}. With the commmissioning of the SIS100 and SuperFRS at GSI it will be achievable to study (p,2p) reactions with very short lived nuclei at reasonable intensities which will presumably draw even more attention to qfs reaction approach.  
\begin{figure}[htpb]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=8cm,keepaspectratio=true]{Figures/spec_red_factors.png}
    \caption{
   	Extracted reduction factors of the spectroscopic strength from (p,2p) measurements (circles and square) as a function of the difference between proton and neutron separation energy $S_p$/$S_n$.

From Ref. \cite{atar2018quasifree}.   
    }
    \label{fig:red_factor}
\end{figure}
\item[Gamma Spectroscopy]Alongside to the study of the single-particle spectroscopic strengths qfs reactions provide valuable information of the shell structure and deformation of the fragment (A-1) via gamma spectroscopy. While quasi-free scattering with nucleons in the outermost shell yield a fragment in the ground state, the scattering with nucleons in inner shells result in bound excited states of the (A-1) fragment. This excited fragment instantaneously transits to the ground state by the emission of a Doppler shifted $\gamma$ ray.\newline
A big advantage of the (p,2p) reaction is ability to make precise vertex reconstruction by accurate measurement of the two outgoing correlated protons. This is of particular importance for extended targets and determines the emission point within the target, enabling an accurate calculation of the fragment’s velocity and therefore a precise Doppler correction.\newline
From gamma spectroscopy the excitation energy E(2+), the first excited state of a nucleus, can be observed which is a fundamental observable of nuclear structure, providing key insights into the shell configuration and deformation of the nucleus\cite{panin2021quasi}. Expecially when going towards exotic neutron rich isotopes the study of the gamma emission lines can strongly contribute to the understanding of nuclear shell evolution.
\item[QFS to probe inner clustering and halo formation]Clusterization inside nuclei is a phenomena widely observed in experimental astrophysics with large implications on processes such as the synthesis of carbon  inside stars via triple $\alpha$ clusterization \cite{hjorth2011carbon}, $\alpha$ - radioactivity, or the evolution of core collapse supernovae\cite{sumiyoshi2008appearance}, just to mention some. Its presence has also to be implemented in the state of the art equation of state calculations.\newline
Single-particle cluster states can be directly accessed via qfs (p,p$\alpha$) reactions. In the low energy regime of 100 AMeV the $^{12}\text{C}(p, p\alpha)^{8}\text{Be}$ reaction, see ref \cite{mabiala2009analyzing}, as benchmark study approved the reaction mechanism and up to a scaling factor the measured cross sections aligned exceptionally well to the free p–$\alpha$ scattering measurements.\newline
Moreover the qfs mechanism allows to acces light nuclei going towards the neutron drip line via (p,pn) reaction. These light nuclei are mostly weakly bound with an extended low density neutron-matter distribution forming a so-called \textit{nuclear-halo}.\newline
The most prominent candidate for such is $^{11}Li$, often called \textit{Borromean three-body system}\cite{johannsen199011li}, consisting of two neutrons interacting with a core ($^9Li$) via weak, short-range interactions. First evidence for the correlation  between the two neutron was strongly pushed by experimental studies at GSI, see \cite{simon1999direct}, and theoretical work by Bertulani et. al.\cite{bertulani2007geometry}.\newline
The latest experiment with the focus on the study of multi-neutron correlations in drip-line nuclei was carried out at R3B in 2022 (experiment S509) probing broad isotopic chains of Li, Be, B, C and N via the qfs mechanism.
\item[Short Range Correlations(SRC)]Short range correlations refer to elementary nucleon-nucleon interactions within a nucleus and occur over very short distances, typically on the order of 1-2 femtometers.  These correlations are characterized by pairs of nucleons with high relative momentum ($> k_F$, Fermi momentum) and low total momentum. These NN- interactions are treated as good explanatory candidate for observed deviations from mean field approximation. Many phenomena, such as the above discussed reduction in the spectroscopic strength and the EMC effect\cite{xing2023electromagnetic}, the observation that  the cross section for deep inelastic scattering from an atomic nucleus is different from that of the same number of free protons and neutrons, are associated to the short range correlations inside the nucleus.\newline
From isotopic chain studies\cite{clas2018probing} it has been shown that there is an indication of SRC depenency on isospin, see figure blabla, where SRC are predominatly preferred by p-n pairs than by nn or pp pairs. This again can have significant impact for asymmetric nuclei and imply a stronger quenching of the spectroscopic strength for proton single particle states below the Fermi momentum for neutron rich matter.\newline  
Since pioneering experiments were made at JLab and Brookhaven via $(e,e'p)$ and $(e,e'n)$ reactions several  experimental campaigns were carried out at GSI with the R3B setup. In 2022 the S509 experiment was performed to exploit for the first time the use of short-lived nuclei scattering off a proton probe in inverse kinematics at R3B, followed by the S091 experiment in 2024 with the focus on probing NN-correlations in atomic nuclei via $(p,pd)$ QFS reactions\cite{paschalis2020nucleon}.
